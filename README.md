# Funny Performance Tests

**This is just a fun project to write some scripts to check which languages are faster at which point.**

### PHP vs Nodejs (loops)

The first little project checks loops between php and nodejs and gives extended information about the execution times.
<br/>
run: `npm run php-node (?tests[number] = 10) (?loops[number] = 1000) (?extendedInformation[bool] = true)`.
