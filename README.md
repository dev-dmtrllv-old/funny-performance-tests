# Funny Performance Tests

**This is just a fun project to write some scripts to check which languages are faster at which point.s**
<br/>

### PHP vs Nodejs (loops)

The first little project checks loops between php and nodejs and gives extended information about the execution times.
<br/>
run: `npm run php-node-loops (?tests[number] = 10) (?loops[number] = 1000) (?simple) (?minimal)`.
- tests: the number of tests you want to run.
- loops: the number of loops it should run inside each test.
- minimal: only show the end calculation of average difference and total difference.
- simple: show all the calculations in simple form. (like minimal but also with the total and average time for each language).
